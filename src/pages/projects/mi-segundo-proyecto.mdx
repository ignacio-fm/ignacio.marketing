👋 Welcome fellow [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) and miminal monochrome blog fan. This starter template provides a starting point to create your own minimal monochrome blog using Tailwind CSS and vanilla Javascript.

The basic blog page layout is available and all using the default Tailwind CSS classes (although there are a few hardcoded style tags). If you are going to use this in your project, you will want to convert the classes into components.
